Android Image Classification
============================

This is an example project capable of performing image classification on a live camera fedd, using a binarized neural network on Android.

Requirements
------------

* android device (minimum required Android version is 4.2 (API level 21))

Usage
-----

Clone the repository, open and compile the project with Android Studio.
If you want to use the library on an device that does not have a armv7 or armv8 processor, you have to recompile the BMXNet library as described [here](https://github.com/hpi-xnor/BMXNet/tree/master/amalgamation), using the correct toolchain.

Please take care when recompiling the library to set the definition of `BINARY_WORD_32` or `BINARY_WORD_64` according to your target architecture and also to convert the model to the right `BINARY_WORD` using the model converter supplied with BMXNet.
